I'm a third-year Electrical & Computer Engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin (Hook 'em). I'm also a member of [Longhorn Racing Solar](https://github.com/lhr-solar) where I previously led the team to develop the [Controls System](https://github.com/lhr-solar/Controls), which is responsible for making sure the :car: goes vroom. I then led the Electrical Team, which allowed me to work on the broader electrical system design, both software and hardware. And now, I serve as the team captain, which means I oversee all operations of the vehicle design process.
